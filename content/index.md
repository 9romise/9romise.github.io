## Vida Xie

Hey, I am Vida Xie, born in 1999, a front-end engineer from China.

I've been working as a front-end engineer for 3 years.

Since 2024, I have been involved in the open-source community and have developed a deep appreciation for it. Although I am still in the exploratory phase, I am trying to contribute to popular projects and continually learning through this experience.
